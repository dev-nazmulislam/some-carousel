It is especially helpful for those looking to start their own online-only business, as well as those who are worried about the possible impact of the death of brick-and-mortar retail stores.",

      "I've completed several online courses as a client for work, and I've always found them to be a great way to enhance my knowledge while having fun. Most of them are offered as a series of lessons, which means you just have to complete them in the order they were offered in. Some of them also include readings, quizzes and tests, which makes them a great way to learn.",

      "I had always wanted to learn how to take pictures, but I didn't know where to start. I decided to take an online course from a photography school and was so happy with it. It really opened my eyes to the fact that I can make money from something I love. I am so looking forward to my next class!",

      "I have always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, but I never knew where to start. So I decided to take up an online course to learn. The whole process is very simple and can be done in a few weeks, with no previous experience. I have learned so much in the short time that I have been at it. It has improved my skills",

      "I'm in the process of buying my first house. I'm going to be moving into it with a friend. I have lived in 3 different places before, so I'm familiar with the process of buying a house and getting it ready for occupancy. I want to make sure I have a few things down before I do it. I have taken a few online courses, but this one has been the best. The instructor, Lori, has a wonderful aura, and she communicates very effectively",
